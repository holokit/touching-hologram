# Mofo

This project is the engineering part of the [first lesson of the HoloKit tutorial](https://docs.holokit.io/for-creators/tutorials-and-case-studies/tutorial-1-use-hand-tracking-for-interacting-with-holograms). It covers topics such as how to use HoloKit stereo rendering, how to place AR objects, and interact with them.

## What is Mofo

Mofo is an augmented reality experience and one of the case studies in the HoloKit tutorial. It enables users to create a particle-style Buddha at any location, triggering interactive effects with hand gestures. Leveraging the HoloKit SDK, this experience supports stereo rendering, allowing users to enhance their experience with the accompanying HoloKit hardware.

After building this project as an iPhone app, first, scan surfaces(floor) around your, tap on screen to place a particle-style Buddha.

Utilizing the hand-tracking feature from the HoloKit SDK, this enables players to interact with the Buddha using their hands.

Additionally, the app offers stereo rendering options for an enhanced mixed reality experience using HoloKit hardware.
